## Severity Ratings For Usability Problems - [Nielson Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-rate-the-severity-of-usability-problems/)
Each usability problem is rated using a scale based off the Nielson Norman Group severity rating scale for usability problems. These ratings take into account the **frequency** of the problem's occurance, the **impact** of the problem on the user, and the **persistence** of the problem throughout the user's process.
| Severity Rating | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | No Issues: well designed features |
| 1 | Cosmetic Problem: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project |
| 2 | Minor Usability Problem: low priority to fix |
| 3 | Major Usability Problem; top priority to fix |
